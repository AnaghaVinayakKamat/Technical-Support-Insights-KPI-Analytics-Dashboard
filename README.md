# Technical-Support-Insights-KPI-Analytics-Dashboard

This project presents an interactive Power BI dashboard built using data from Kaggleâ€™s Technical Support Dataset. The dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of key technical support performance indicators (KPIs) to monitor and enhance customer support efficiency.

ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

Analyze ticket volume and trends over time.

Track average response and resolution times using DAX measures.

Evaluate Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) across products.

Identify the most and least reported product issues.

Provide insights to improve overall support operations.

ðŸ§  Tools & Technologies

Power BI: For building interactive visualizations and dashboards.

DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): For creating calculated measures and KPIs.
